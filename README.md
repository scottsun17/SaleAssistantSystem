## Sales Assistant Section
This section of the system allows team rocket sale assistant to log each purchase and sell of Pokemon. Here is a description of the functionalities:

 - Purchase a Pokemon: 
	 - Assistant records each Pokemon purchased; if team rocket has already had that Pokemon in inventory, the purchasing operation will be denied.
	 - Each purchase requires sales assistant to record purchase price and estimated sell price. Sales assistant cannot purchase a Pokemon at a price higher than its' estimated sell price 
 - Sell a Pokemon:
	 - Assistant records the actual selling price, marked the Pokemon as sold in record, and record the assistant ID in record for the sell
	 - The system prevents  assistant from selling a Pokemon at price lower than purchase price
 - Check Inventory:
	 - List out all available Pokemon for sale
- Check Pokemon Information by PokeIndex:
	- Allow sale assistant to quickly look up Pokemon information such as attack, defense, and other status
	- Help assistant determines the value of a Pokemon
- Clear Screen

## Database (JSON Files)
The system relies on three database tables for operations:
 1. External Pokemon Database - [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json) file by [Fanzeyi](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json)
 2. Internal Database for username and password management - [account.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottsun17/SaleAssistantSystem/master/code/data/account.json)
 3. Internal Database for transaction management - [record.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottsun17/SaleAssistantSystem/master/code/data/record.json)

## Flow Chart
The system flow chart walks through basic design of the system. 
![System Flow Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottsun17/SaleAssistantSystem/master/pic/SystemChart.png)

## Known Bugs:
1. The creating new account function does not check pre-existing accounts in the JSON file. One may creates a new account with the exact same username and credential.
2. All internal information (Pokedex information is external JSON) are stored locally and shared. No procedures in place to prevent concurrency problems. It may cause lost updates.
3. Selling and purchasing operations are not recorded until the sales assistant perform save and exit operations. If the program crashes during operation, all previous non-saved operations will be lost.
4.  Account credentials are stored in plain texts.

## Further Possible Development
1. Add UI
2. Solve known bugs above
3. Add manager log in page
4. Develop into a web application that can be accessed on browser
5. Add function to remove existing accounts 
6. Add function to record purchasing assistant's ID. Currently the program only logs the ID of assistant that made the sale. 
7. Add Purchasing Date and Selling Date
